# Tetris Learning Strategies

This program was forked from an online repository: Wcabynessa/Tetris-AI.
Using this repository as our basic foundation, we heavily adjusted the code to fit our needs. We overall adjusted the code to match what we were looking for. We also changed the features to the five features we wanted to focus on and added functions such as Look Two Steps Ahead and Testing.
